Any Third Party Travel Products which you find and/or book via our Services or Platforms are provided by independent Travel Providers.

                                        Parceltube facilitates your bookings with Travel Providers but is not responsible and has no liability to you in respect of such bookings. The identity of the relevant Travel Provider and the terms and conditions applicable to your booking with them (“Travel Provider Terms”) will be notified to you at the time of booking and you should ensure that you read and fully understand them before completing your booking. The only exception to this is if you’ve booked with Parceltube’s Travel Service, which is subject to a different set of terms and conditions. Unless your booking confirmation has come from Parceltube, then this is unlikely to affect you.

                                        The Travel Provider Terms should set out what rights you have against the Travel Provider and will explain their liability to you in the event of anything going wrong.

                                        You agree to comply in full with all applicable Travel Provider Terms. You acknowledge that breaching Travel Provider Terms could result in the cancellation of tickets or reservations, revocation of frequent flier miles and other benefits, and additional charges.

                                        Where you have used our Platforms to book two or more related travel products within a 24-hour period (for example a flight and hotel booked separately but within 24 hours of each other) then this may be classified as a “Linked Travel Arrangement” depending on where you are located and the applicable consumer protection laws that apply. Where a Linked Travel Arrangement has been created, you will not have the same level of consumer protection that you would get where you book both a flight and hotel together through one single agent (where you may then get the benefits that apply to booking holiday packages). This means that you need to rely on each individual Travel Provider to perform their services, and do not have legal recourse to the organiser or the retailer of a package. In the event of the insolvency of one of the providers involved in the Linked Travel Arrangement, the protections available under the EU Package Travel Regulations will not apply.
